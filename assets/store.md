# SIT

**Schmandi's Initiative Tracker**

Initiative and Effects Tracker with battle rounds counter.

![initiative_display](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manuelpoell/sit/main/screenshots/display_initiative.png)

**Tracking Initiative**

You can add tokens to the initiative tracker by their context menu and assign their rolled initiative to them!

The list will be automatically sorted from high to low!

**Tracking Battle Rounds**

Everytime the initiative list starts from the top again, the battle rounds counter will be keeping track of the current round, so you can always keep track of your time management!

**Tracking Effects**

When characters cast spells or effects, you can add those effects with their duration in battle rounds to the tracker as well! When an effects round counter drops to 0, every player will be notified!
